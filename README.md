## How to use it

To clone the program on your local computer you can run 
```
'git clone https://github.com/TakanoriCodronAkieda/Amazing-graphs.git'
```
into the command line / terminal of your machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need Matplotlib in order to run this code.  
Matplotlib is a popular python library used to plot data.  
Here's a link to Matplotlib's official documentation: https://matplotlib.org/

### Installing Matplotlib

If you don't already have pip added to your environment PATH, I recommend that you watch the following tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emYR6vVHxp8  
If you have pip added to your environment PATH, you can simply run 'pip install matplotlib' to install the library.  

## Future work

It would be great to have the 'Balanced ternary' graph from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8c4uYnnNnc& on this repository in the future.
