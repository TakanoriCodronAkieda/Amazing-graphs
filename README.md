## How to use it

To clone the program on your local computer you can run

```
into the command line / terminal of your machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need Matplotlib in order to run this code.

## Future work

It would be great to have the 'Balanced ternary' graph from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8c4uYnnNnc& on this repository in the future.
